# Tp-Link router integration for Home Assistant
Home Assistant component for TP-Link router administration based on the [TP-Link Router API](https://github.com/AlexandrErohin/TP-Link-Archer-C6U)

> [!WARNING]
> Please temporarily disable the integration before accessing the router admin page. TP-Link admin page only allows one user at a time. This integration will log you out of the admin page every time it scans for updates (every 30s by default).

See [Supported routers](#supports)

### Sensors
 - Total amount of wired clients
 - Total amount of IoT clients
 - Total amount of host wifi clients
 - Total amount of guest wifi clients
 - Total amount of all connected clients
 - CPU used
 - Memory used

### Device Tracker
 - Track connected to router devices by MAC address with connection information

To find your device - Go to `Developer tools` and search for your MAC address - youâ€™ll find sensor like `device_tracker.YOUR_MAC` or `device_tracker.YOUR_PHONE_NAME`.

It will also fire Home Assistant event when a device connects to router

### Services
 - Send SMS message - Available only for MR LTE routers

### Notification
To receive notifications of appearing a new device in your network, or becoming device online\offline add following lines to your `configuration.yaml` file:
```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "New network device"
    trigger:
      platform: event
      event_type: tplink_router_new_device
    action:
      service: notify.mobile_app_<device_name>
      data:
        content: >-
          New device appear {{ trigger.event.data.hostname }} with IP {{ trigger.event.data.ip_address }}
```

All available fields in `trigger.event.data`:
- hostname
- ip_address
- mac_address
- connection
- band
- packets_sent
- packets_received

### Send SMS only for MR LTE routers
To send SMS add following lines to your automation in yaml:
```yaml
...
action:
  - service: tplink_router.send_sms
    data:
      number: ""pass phone number here"
      text: "pass text here"
      device: "pass tplink router device id here"
```

Device id is required because user may have several routers that could send SMS - so you need to select the needed router

## Installation

### HACS (recommended)

Have [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) installed, this will allow you to update easily.

<a href="https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=AlexandrErohin&repository=home-assistant-tplink-router&category=integration" target="_blank"><img src="https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg" alt="Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store." /></a>

or go to <b>Hacs</b> and search for `TP-Link Router`.

### Manual

1. Locate the `custom_components` directory in your Home Assistant configuration directory. It may need to be created.
2. Copy the `custom_components/tplink_router` directory into the `custom_components` directory.
3. Restart Home Assistant.

## Configuration
TP-Link Router is configured via the GUI. See [the HA docs](https://www.home-assistant.io/getting-started/integration/) for more details.

The default data is preset already.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlexandrErohin/home-assistant-tplink-router/master/docs/media/config_flow.png" width="48%">

1. Go to the <b>Settings</b>-><b>Devices & services</b>.
2. Click on `+ ADD INTEGRATION`, search for `TP-Link Router`.
3. Fill Password.
4. Click `SUBMIT`

NOTE!
1. If you use `https` connection to your router you may get error `certificate verify failed: EE certificate key too weak`. To fix this - unset `Verify ssl`
2. Use Local Password which is for Log In with Local Password. Login with TP-LINK ID doesnt work

3. If you got error - `use web encrypted password instead. Check the documentation!` Read [web encrypted password](#encrypted_pass)
4. The TP-Link Web Interface only supports upto 1 user logged in at a time (for security reasons, apparently). So you will be logged out from router web interface when the integration updates data

### <a id="encrypted_pass">Web Encrypted Password</a>
If you got error - `use web encrypted password instead. Check the documentation!`
1. Go to the login page of your router. (default: 192.168.0.1).
2. Type in the password you use to login into the password field.
3. Click somewhere else on the page so that the password field is not selected anymore.
4. Open the JavaScript console of your browser (usually by pressing F12 and then clicking on "Console").
5. Type `document.getElementById("login-password").value;`
6. Copy the returned value as password and use it.

### Edit Configuration
You may edit configuration data like:
1. Router url
2. Password
3. Scan interval
4. Verify https

To do that:

1. Go to the <b>Settings</b>-><b>Devices & services</b>.
2. Search for `TP-Link Router`, and click on it.
3. Click on `CONFIGURE`
4. Edit the options you need and click `SUBMIT`
